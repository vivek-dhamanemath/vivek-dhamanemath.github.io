## About

Hello! I'm Vivek J Dhamanemath, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a Master's degree in Computer Applications (MCA). With a keen interest in Java programming and web development, I thrive on creating intuitive, user-friendly solutions.

## Projects

Here are some of the technical projects I have worked on:

1. **Facial Recognition Attendance System**
   - Our project revolutionizes attendance management with facial recognition technology. It uses advanced algorithms to accurately identify individuals by analyzing unique facial features captured via camera. The system ensures reliability by accommodating variations in lighting, expressions, and aging, eliminating the need for manual sign-ins or badge swipes.

2. **Bank Management System**
   - The "Bank Account Management System" is an Internet Banking application that lets customers manage their accounts online. It simulates standard banking processes, enabling features like deposits, withdrawals, account setup, and reporting. Shifting from traditional banking to a 24/7 virtual platform, it offers global access and convenience, removing barriers to transactions anytime, anywhere.
